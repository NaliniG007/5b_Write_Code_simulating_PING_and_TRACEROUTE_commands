# 5b_Write_Code_simulating_PING_and_TRACEROUTE_commands
## AIM:
To write the python program for simulating ping command and_TRACEROUTE_commands.
## ALGORITHM FOR PING Command
Step 1: start the program.
<BR>
Step 2: Include necessary package in java 
<BR>
Step 3: To create a process object p to implement the ping command
<BR>
Step 4: declare one Buffered Reader stream class object
<BR>
Step 5: Get the details of the server
<BR>
 1.length of the IP address.
 <BR>
 2.Time required to get the details.
 <BR>
 3.Send packets, receive packets and lost packets.
 <BR>
 4.Minimum, maximum and average times.
 <BR>
Step 6:Print the results.
<BR>
Step 7: Stop the program.
<BR>
## ALGORITHM FOR TRACEROUTE_command
1. Start the program <BR>
2.Get the frame size from the user.
<BR>
3.To create the frame based on the user request.
<BR>
4.To send frames to server from the client side.
<BR>
5.If your frames reach the server, it will send ACK signal to client
<BR>
otherwise it will sendNACK signal to client.
<BR>
6.Stop the prog
